# STRATECInternshipProblem2020

This repository contains mine and Coroama Diana-Mihaela's attempt at solving "The 2020 Internship Software Challenge" from STRATEC Biomedical company. 

The goal of the software is to accurately connect the dots. While making sure every pin has the option to connect , it is mandatory to keep at least one block free between the two roads connecting the dots with the same values. 

This program was made in collaboration with Coroama Diana-Mihaela

For step one , the program outputs:

For the third step (which needed to make some roads that do run into each other and indicate where they intersect ):

The last step was the most challenging one. We opted to the user to input their desired number of lines and columns. After submitting the user could input their own pins( each number corresponding to their extremities ). One thing to mention is that the user should be careful when inputting that the roads can be made, if they can't the program will go on a continuous loop re-making the roads trying to make them all fit and in will end up crashing. 

One example of user inputting matrix(where the matrix is 20x20) is:
