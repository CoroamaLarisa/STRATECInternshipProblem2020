# STRATECInternshipProblem2020

This repository contains mine and Coroama Diana-Mihaela's attempt at solving "The 2020 Internship Software Challenge" from STRATEC Biomedical company. 

The goal of the software is to accurately connect the dots. While making sure every pin has the option to connect , it is mandatory to keep at least one block free between the two roads connecting the dots with the same values. 

This program was made in collaboration with Coroama Diana-Mihaela

For step one , the program outputs:
